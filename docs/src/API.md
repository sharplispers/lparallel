## API

The lparallel API is divided into five packages:

    lparallel.kernel
    lparallel.promise
    lparallel.cognate
    lparallel.ptree
    lparallel.defpun

For convenience, the exported symbols of each package are also exported by the lparallel package.

The lparallel.queue package provides a queue for inter-thread communication. It is not included in the lparallel package.
